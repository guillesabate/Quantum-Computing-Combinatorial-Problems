    "## 1) Introduction\n",
    "This section serves as an introduction to the topic of variational quantum algorithms and as a recap of the material covered in the previous lecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Variational quantum algorithms\n",
    "In the most general sense, a variational quantum circuit is a circuit that depends on a set of parameters $\\theta$. Typically, a variational quantum algorithm queries a quantum computer to sample the output of this parameterized quantum circuit for some fixed parameters and evaluates a given cost function $C(\\theta)$ based on this output. A classical optimizer is then used to update the circuit parameters in order to maximize or minimize the objective function $C$. These steps are repeated in a quantum-classical hybrid loop that eventually terminates when the classical optimization has found optimal parameters $\\theta^*$.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Variational Quantum Algorithms are often seen as a promising method of achieving quantum advantage on near term devices. In a lot of cases they do not require the execution of deep quantum circuits and systematic errors can partly be mitigated by outsourcing the optimization procedure to a classical optimizer. Nevertheless, VQAs also face a number of challenges, in particular the questions of whether they are efficiently trainable and produce solutions that are in fact superior to those obtained by classical algorithms. \n",
    "Despite these challenges, VQAs have been proposed for a variety of problem settings, amongst others the following.\n",
    "\n",
    "- [Variational Quantum Eigensolvers](/course/ch-applications/simulating-molecules-using-vqe): \n",
    "VQEs attempt to approximate the ground state and corresponding energy of a quantum system described by a Hamiltonian $H$ (i.e. the lowest eigenvalue and eigenvector of the corresponding hermitian matrix) (see [below](#variational-quantum-eigensolvers)).\n",
    "\n",
    "- [QAOA](/course/ch-applications/solving-combinatorial-optimization-problems-using-qaoa): An approximate optimization algorithm used for combinatorial optimization problems. QAOA can be seen as a VQE that solves optimization problems by encoding the cost function as a problem Hamiltonian (see [Section 4](#qaoa)).\n",

    "### The Variational Method\n",
    "Consider a Hermitian operator $H$ describing a quantum system with corresponding ground state $\\vert \\psi^* \\rangle$ and ground state energy $E_0$.\n",
    "The variational method is a technique to approximate $\\vert \\psi^* \\rangle$ and $E_0$. This is done by choosing a parameterized trial state $\\vert \\psi(\\theta) \\rangle$, where $\\theta$ denotes a set or vector of parameters. Recall that the energy of the system in the state $\\vert \\psi \\rangle$ is given by its expectation value with respect to $H$\n",
    "$$\n",
    "E(\\vert \\psi \\rangle)= \\langle \\psi \\vert H \\vert \\psi \\rangle\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Since the ground state of the system is the lowest energy eigenstate, by definition it holds that\n",
    "$$\n",
    "E_0 = \\langle \\psi^* \\vert H \\vert \\psi^* \\rangle \\leq \\langle \\psi(\\theta) \\vert H \\vert \\psi(\\theta) \\rangle,\n",
    "$$\n",
    "for any parameters $\\theta$. Thus, by minimizing the expectation value of the trial state $\\psi(\\theta)$, that is, finding parameters $\\theta$ for which the expectation value $\\langle \\psi(\\theta) \\vert H \\vert \\psi(\\theta) \\rangle$ becomes as small as possible, we obtain an upper bound on the ground state energy $E_0$ and an approximation of the ground state itself. Naturally, the choice of a good trial state $\\psi(\\theta)$ is principal to the success of the variational method.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Variational Quantum Eigensolvers\n",
    "Variational quantum eigensolvers use the variational method to approximate the ground state and minimal eigenvalue of a Hamiltonian $H$. The trial state now corresponds to a quantum state prepared by a variational quantum circuit and the corresponding expectation value is measured by executing the circuit on a quantum computer. A classical optimizer is then used to tune the circuit parameters and minimize the measured expectation value.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Apart from being applicable to problems in chemistry or quantum mechanics itself, where we are directly interested in the ground state of a given Hamiltonian, one can also use the concept of variational quantum eigensolvers for optimization problems, by encoding the cost function that should be optimized as a Hamiltonian whose ground state corresponds to the optimal solution of the problem. This idea lies at the heart of QAOA.\n",
